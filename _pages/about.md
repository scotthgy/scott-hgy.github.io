Hi, I'm a master student in Data Science at the University of Sydney. My research topics are about using large language models (LLMs) for separating homogeneous instrument sounds from mixed audio, enhancing accuracy and efficiency through advanced audio-visual data processing and feature extraction techniques.

My research interests include audio-visual separation, large language models (LLMs), and feature extraction techniques.
